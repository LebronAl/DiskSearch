What is software ?

Computer software, or simply software, is 

that part of a computer system that 

consists of encoded information or 

computer instructions, in contrast to the 

physical hardware from which the system 

is built.

How to classify software ?

Application software, which is software that uses the 

computer system to perform special functions or 

provide entertainment functions beyond the basic 

operation of the computer itself. 

System software, which is software that directly 

operates the computer hardware, to provide basic 

functionality needed by users and other software, 

and to provide a platform for running application 

software.

How to program ?

The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages that 

are easier and more efficient for programmers, meaning closer to a natural 

language.[1] High-level languages are translated into machine language

using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may 

also be written in a low-level assembly language, essentially, a vaguely 

mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language 

alphabet, which is translated into machine language using an assembler.

Use a programming language!
